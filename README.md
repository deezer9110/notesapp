# This was meant to help me learn about creating and deploying a full stack app with aws amplify
Unfortunately, because the tutorial doesn't seem to be maintained properly and after running into many issues with vite and amplify versions clashing, and now completely missing code to design the required login page, i'm leaving it here and moving on to something I can actually do. Still will leave this up to show that I tried.
